# Welcome to our DELIcious Deli! 
Here you will find a fully customizable sandwich shop. Where Customers can order sandwiches in 3 sizes (4", 8" and 12").
When they order, they choose the type of bread that they would like (white, wheat, rye, or wrap).
The customer can then choose their toppings. Toppings are categorized as regular and premium. Meats and cheeses are premium toppings, but most other toppings are considered regular.

Customers can request for extra toppings, but premium toppings come at an additional cost.
Each sandwich can also be toasted.
A customer can place an order with 1 or more sandwiches on the order.
When a customer places the order, they should be prompted to customize each sandwich one at a time. A customer should also be able to add drinks and chips to their order.
